Transcription: "My Notes"

Hello, my name is Hadji Rami and i'm from
 
from M'sila
 
 Country
 
 Algeria

This is my final project for Harvard's CS50.

My Note It is an easy to use website You can take notes. You can write down what is on your mind quickly and refer to it at any time and from anywhere. On this site, you can easily write notes, memos, emails, letters and shopping lists. And many, many ideas.

 
I created a project notes
 
By using the Flask framework
 
And a little JavaScript and HTML & CSS

My project consists of 3 web pages. These pages are inside the templates file
 
-1-sign up
 
-2- login
 
-3-home

The front end is written mostly in Python with some libraries built in for things like coding libraries, hashing passwords, 
 
 and checking and matching hash passwords at login.

I also added the SQLAlchemy toolkit
 
Which gives application developers the complete power and flexibility of SQL.
 
SQLAlchemy provides a full suite of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for efficient and high-performing database access, 
 
 adapted into a simple and Pythonic domain language.
 
Now when you are able to log in, you will be able to keep all the notes and ideas that were in your mind and refer to them 
 
 at all times and from anywhere because they are stored on the site.

This is my final project and this was cs50.
